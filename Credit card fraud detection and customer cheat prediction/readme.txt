This code is for credit-card fraud detection and customer cheating probability. Combining these two with hybrid method. hybridDLM contains  both fraud detection and cheating prediction code.
In this hybridDLM.ipynb file, there is three part.
Part-1:
  Credit card fraud detection using self organization map (SOM)
Part-2:
  moving unsupervised to supervised learning
Part-3:
  Predict the probability of customer cheating using artificial neural network (ANN)
